## Overview
This project predicts the survival of lung cancer patients using a machine learning model. It leverages clinical and demographic data to provide accurate survival predictions, assisting healthcare professionals in decision-making.

## Dataset
- Place your dataset as `data/dataset_med.csv`.
- The dataset should include columns like: `age`, `gender`, `country`, `diagnosis_date`, `cancer_stage`, `family_history`, `smoking_status`, `bmi`, `cholesterol_level`, `hypertension`, `asthma`, `cirrhosis`, `other_cancer`, `treatment_type`, `end_treatment_date`, and `survived`.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the pipeline:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
After running the pipeline, the script will:
- Load and preprocess the data
- Train a Random Forest model to predict survival
- Print accuracy and a classification report

**Example Output:**
```
Accuracy: 0.85
Classification Report:
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.83      0.88      0.85       100
           1       0.87      0.82      0.84       100

    accuracy                           0.85       200
   macro avg       0.85      0.85      0.85       200
weighted avg       0.85      0.85      0.85       200
```
